            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>GuestSpot User Agreement (Revised Plain-Language Summary)</strong></p>
            <p>
              Welcome to GuestSpot! This summary gives you a clear, plain-language overview of our Terms of Service. If there is ever a conflict between this summary and the full Terms, the full Terms control as the legally binding document.
            </p>
            <p>Think of this as the quick guide to what you can expect from us and what we expect from you.</p>

          <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>1. Who Can Use GuestSpot</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Adults Only:</strong> You must be 18 or older (or the age of majority where you live, if higher) to use GuestSpot.</li>
              <li><strong>Honest Info:</strong> Sign up with your real name and accurate information.</li>
              <li><strong>One Account:</strong> Maintain a single account. If you run a shop and also have an artist profile, we will guide you without duplicating accounts.</li>
              <li><strong>No Minors:</strong> Accounts for minors are not allowed, and you may not let a minor use your account.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>2. Your Account Responsibilities</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Keep It Secure:</strong> Do not share your password. You are responsible for everything that happens on your account.</li>
              <li><strong>Update Info:</strong> Keep your email, phone, and other key details current so we can reach you with important notices.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Professional Conduct (for Providers):</strong> Present yourself accurately.
                <ul>
                  <li>List the correct business hours, prices, and services you actually offer.</li>
                  <li>Maintain required licenses or permits and follow local laws, including health regulations.</li>
                  <li>Treat clients with respect and professionalism.</li>
                </ul>

          <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>3. Booking and Payments</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Booking Deposits:</strong> Clients pay a deposit set by the Provider, which goes to the artist or shop once the appointment happens.</li>
              <li><strong>5% GuestSpot Fee:</strong> A 5% platform fee is added on top of the deposit. It keeps GuestSpot running and is non-refundable once paid.</li>
              <li><strong>Providers Get the Full Deposit:</strong> GuestSpot does not take a cut of your deposit. We only keep the 5% platform fee.</li>
              <li><strong>Payments Stay on Platform:</strong> All initial payments must flow through GuestSpot&apos;s secure payment partner. Off-platform payments to avoid fees violate the rules.</li>
              <li><strong>Final Payments:</strong> Remaining balances are handled directly between client and Provider (often at the appointment) unless otherwise noted.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>4. Cancellations &amp; Refunds</h2>
            <p>Life happens&mdash;here is how we handle changes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Client Cancels Early:</strong> Cancel at least 48 hours before the appointment to receive your deposit back. The 5% fee is not refunded.</li>
              <li><strong>Client Cancels Late:</strong> Cancel within 48 hours (or no-show) and the deposit is forfeited. The 5% fee also remains non-refundable.</li>
              <li><strong>Provider Cancels:</strong> If the artist or shop cancels, the client receives the deposit back. GuestSpot may also refund the 5% fee as a courtesy, especially for last-minute cancellations.</li>
              <li><strong>Changing Plans:</strong> When both parties agree to reschedule, the existing deposit can usually move to the new date. Communicate and loop in GuestSpot if you need help.</li>
              <li><strong>No-Shows:</strong> A client no-show forfeits the deposit. If a Provider no-shows, contact us so we can assist and make it right.</li>
              <li><strong>Product Purchases:</strong> Refunds or returns for products bought through GuestSpot&apos;s marketplace are handled between the buyer and the seller. GuestSpot will help facilitate communication, but the seller is responsible for resolving product issues.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
